  The slogan of Slick slider library is 'the last carousel you'll ever need', I
  completely agree with it. I reckon that Slick slider is the simpliest library
  to figure out how it works and set up a slider in ~10 minutes and then some
  more time to style it up to your needs. Slick documentation is pretty straight
  forward to understand.
