# FE FWs

Some FE frameworks(FW) with Sass/LESS you can make, ex: w/ Prepros.io


SemanticUI and 'UI Kit' are eliminated due to size.

Default FW is Spectre. Two version are made, one with NavBar, and one with OffScreen, both are 3rd party Open Source libraries.

Also made is gridforms and navbar. You should learn now to use Prepros.io to make your own version.


Fullpage example is good for slides, docs, simple sites.
