# FE FWs

Selected FE(Front End) frameworks(FW) with Sass/LESS you can make, ex: w/ Prepros.io

SemanticUI and 'UI Kit' are eliminated due to size.

Default FW is Spectre. Two version are made, one with NavBar js (in navjBar folder, used in navSite and linkBlog examples), and one with OffScreen js (simple and default, use in 4 examples, both are 3rd party Open Source libraries.

Also made is gridform and navbar. You should learn now to use Prepros.io to make your own version.

But there are many FE FWs, you'll end up learning a few. You should know how to solve a problem, such as nav, in at least FE FW.
