Selected SCSS theme frameworks with Sass/LESS you can make, ex: w/ Prepros.io

SemanticUI and 'UI Kit' are eliminated due to size.

Default Theme is Spectre. Two version are made, one with NavBar js (in navjBar folder, used in webSite and linkBlog examples), and one with OffScreen js (simple and default, use in 4 examples, both are 3rd party Open Source libraries.

Also made is gridform and navbar. You should learn now to use Prepros.io to make your own version.

But there are many FE FWs, you'll end up learning a few. Even then, most intricate things, like navigation, ends up custom. You should know how to solve a problem, such as nav, in at least FE FW.
