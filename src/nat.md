#1. make example like docuSar in this folder.
 first 'run that folder here via any local http server

from/for http://staticgen.com , that is the docuSarus sample
docuSarus is used by http://riot.js.org - sad!

we use yaml.doc for some things
but include some of the 'style guide' that is there

include landing page, blog and doc|api

pug example should be teachable to 'dummies' 

Maybe use lorem ipsum text
and something like this for images http://holderjs.com

dat.yaml is used to setup a the page. For eample left menu.

1.A: may need to fix json -i in mbCLI - htts://jsonfeed.org/version/1, use that spec
to make items

1.B: May need to touch up of our home madeglobal css, used instead of spectre. I spent a bit to much time to line height/vertical rytam and such. nav requires no .js.

1.C: Maybe the left side of page that shows jsonfeed.json should be a custom element we host. It would make it simpler to use


Also, delete that folder docuSar when done and this file: nat.md.
