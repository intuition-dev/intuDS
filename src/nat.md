#1. make example like docuSar in template folder, but include some of the 'style' that is there

 from/for http://staticgen.com , that is the docuSarus sample
docuSarus is used by http://riot.js.org - sad!

1.A: may need to fix json -i in mbCLI  htts://jsonfeed.org/version/1, use that spec
to make items

1.B: May need to touch up of our global css. I spent a bit to much time to line height/vertical rytam

pug example should be teachable to 'dummies' 

include landing page, blog and doc|api

dat.yaml is used to setup a the page. For eample left menu.
Maybe the left should be a custom element we host

Also, delete that folder zdocuSar when done and this file: nat.md.

Maybe use lorem ipsum text
and something like this for images http://holderjs.com
