### Definition
What is the Low-code and who is the Citizen Developer:

A citizen developer is a non-professional developer who builds applications for use by other people. Although they do not report directly to IT, they use tools such as low-code platforms that are sanctioned by IT.

Low-code frameworks/tools - an emerging category that supports rapid assembly of customer-facing applications, requiring minimal hand-coding and enabling productive new development practices — Forrester

### History

Everything has started with the idea of having a regular person/non-developer, but someone who is willing to learn and grow, to be able to create an application using a low-code tool, without over complicating things,  and that's how `mbake` was invented.

in 2019 more and more people require to know the basics of javascript and HTML, and mbake was built with that idea in mind.

You have all the flexibility that developers need to build a complex app but also simplicity and convenience that citizen developer wants to develop a simple app.

It is not a GUI tool that makes user drag and drop block's in a specific order to build the app, its a freedom of your 10 fingers to create/write your app as you would want it to be.

Let your creativity to flow.

### It is not a future anymore, the future already is here!

With the flexibility of low-code application development, innovation becomes a playing field. Failure is a thing of the past: it’s simply an indication that you need to change a few things. The ability to experiment and change along the way gives you all the power to create solutions that are 100% fit to your needs. Changes that took a development team hours can be done now by a citizen developer in a few steps.

Technology is ready, so you should be too!
