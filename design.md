# Principles of design

## Unity/harmony

When all elements are in agreement. A good balance between unity and variety.

### Methods

* **Perspective:** sense of distance between elements.
* **Similarity:** ability to seem repeatable with other elements.
* **Continuation:** the sense of having a line or pattern extend.
* **Repetition:** elements being copied or mimicked numerous times.
* **Rhythm:** is achieved when recurring position, size, color, and use of a graphic element has a focal point interruption.
* **Altering** the basic theme achieves unity and helps keep interest.


## Balance

It is a state of equalized tension and equilibrium, which may not always be calm.

### Types of balance in visual design

* Symmetry
* Asymmetrical balance produces an informal balance that is attention attracting and dynamic.
* Radial balance is arranged around a central element.
* Overall is a mosaic form of balance which normally arises from too many elements being put on a page. Due to the lack of hierarchy and contrast, this form of balance can look noisy but sometimes quiet.

## Hierarchy

A good design contains elements that lead the reader through each element in order of its significance. The type and images should be expressed starting from most important to the least important.

## Scale/proportion

Using the relative size of elements against each other can attract attention to a focal point.

## Space

Space, or "negative space". The principle of space allows viewers to have the freedom to move through a design and discover each element. If you don't leave enough "breathing room" in your design, your positive elements can become visually overwhelming, appearing messy and cluttered. Space can also convey attributes such as simplicity, cleanliness and openness. Space should be thought out and considered â€“ you don't want to waste space by overfilling the composition with positive elements. Overfilling will not allow a connection between all the spaces in the design.

## Dominance/emphasis

Dominance is created by contrasting size, positioning, color, style, or shape.

## Similarity and contrast

Planning a consistent and similar design is an important aspect of a designer's work to make their focal point visible. Too much similarity is boring but without similarity important elements will not exist and an image without contrast is uneventful so the key is to find the balance between similarity and contrast.

### Similar environment

There are several ways to develop a similar environment:

* Build a unique internal organization structure.
* Manipulate shapes of images and text to correlate together.
* Express continuity from page to page in publications (headers, themes, borders, and spaces).
* Develop a style manual and adhere to it.
