#1. make example like docuSar in pugIntro folder
( from/for http://staticgen.com )
docuSarus is used by http://riot.js.org - sad.

1.a may need to fix json -i in mbCLI  htts://jsonfeed.org/version/1

0. use the /src css.
there is a nav bar without .js example

pug example should be teachable to 'dummies' 
include landing page, blog and doc|api

instead of front matter markdown we use yaml
