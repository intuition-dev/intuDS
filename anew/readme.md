#1. make example like docuSar in pugIntro folder
( from/for http://staticgen.com )
docuSarus is used by http://riot.js.org - sad.

1.a may need to fix json -i in mbCLI  htts://jsonfeed.org/version/1

0.a there is few 'checkbox' nav. examples here
 eg http://getpapercss.com/docs/components/navbar
0.b touch up 'css' SRC here, the example needs to be nicer checkbox nav
 notice new way of fonts to be AMP
 and clean html and sass
 (came from http://mincss.com )
0.c check out classs names for css from docusar and maybe touch up our css
0.d release new css via git release. ( I have to release the pug first time)

pug example should be teachable to 'dummies' 
include landing page, blog and doc|api

instead of front matter markdown we use yaml ?

so just an example is the idea

(ps I still have no income yet myself, but using time to make mbCLI nicer, and need help)
