## Importance 
The outlook if website is its main selling point. If website looks nice the user would stay and inspect it, if it's a mess - a lot would leave without even figuring out why's your product awesome.

And if you are thinking that you would sort out lazy people or people caring about only looks you are wrong: disign is the first thing to judge by about how considirate to the user you are, how many effort/money you are putting in your product in generall. Or may not always be the true, but it's how people percieve, the creterea they use in the world of overflowing information/products. 

So the role of designer is criticall for selling your product.

## Misunderstanding
Some developers and marketers may misunderstand design.

The first one sometimes would say that UI should be convenient and will be right, but it's not all it's about. Avarage developer without an understanding of design should not just add or remove things to UI, make major changes without consulting designer. 

The second one sometimes can comeup with something interesting, like "I noticed websites using Roboto have better sails, let's use it everywhere. 16 px.. I met severall marketers who were ignorant to the fact that design is about the whole picture, that some feature in one product or design picture may be percieved as cool in in some they are just out of place. 

## CSS
Web designer should understand css, just because it's a tool their work is going to be implemented with.
