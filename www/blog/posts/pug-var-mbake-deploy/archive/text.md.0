## Handle multiple development environments with mbake and pug as easy as ride a bike -0

Mbake is a tool that helps develop an app as quickly as possible, in conjunction with pug, scss, ts and livereload it makes setup of the app in seconds, no need for learning the new framework in order to build the project. Mbake build with vanilla JS, that makes extending it pretty simple.

So when you reach the stage of deploying your project to the server, you might want to use `.min.js` instead of `.js`, but renaming it each time you deploy it, is not an option, this when it comes in handly variables in pug

## In the `header.pug` set the variable:
```pug
-var EXT = ".min.js";
script.
    window.EXT = '#{EXT}' // in order to use it in .js files at your project 
```
    
## Adjust all script's src
```pug
script(src='some_js_here' + EXT)
```
At this step when `mbake` will compile your files, it replace's all `EXT` with `.min.js`

So only a few lines of code let you set up the basic dev environment
