Speed to market is a competitive advantage and a must if you want to succeed in today's rapidly changing environment.  Not all companies have the infrastructure or resources to react, innovate or develop quickly enough.  That's where INTUITION  comes in.  We get you where you need to be 10x faster at 1/10th the cost. 


Quick development is a pre-requisite for agile development: So that week to week you can accomplish your agile tasks. Quick development is the only way to complete a project: you must finish tasks at a quicker rate than requirements change - think of it as having escape velocity. If you donâ€™t have enough velocity: gravity will pull you crashing down. and, quick development is a pre-requisite for reacting to your market and your customers. Think of if as tracer bullets way to react to a market.

But to be quick: you must be cost effective, productive and efficient. You have to be quick and cost effective.

I think you can eliminate the above.  Saying you are 10x faster at 1/10th the cost says more than what the above says....  If you have to say something, say:

Fast.  Efficient. Agile.  That' s MetaBake!

I like using 1/10th the cost vs. cheaper because cheap equates to poor quality so you should use 1/10th the cost throughout your website or eliminate the word Cheap wherever you see it...
