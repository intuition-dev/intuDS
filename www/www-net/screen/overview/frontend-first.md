#### Why
* Front-End is currently undergoing an accelerated evolution: Front-End tech stacks become outdated easily with new tools and patterns appearing almost each week/month.
* Meanwhile, Back-end structures suffer less change than Front-End Stacks.
* Therefore, it's imperative to build first a **solid, scalable and performant Front-End.**
* We are able to hand working prototypes to costumers to interact with and gather better feedback for future development iterations.

#### Advantages
* We are able to hand working prototypes to costumers to interact with and gather better feedback for future development iterations
* We first make sure that we understand the client requirements and deliver an efficient UI and UX that suits the needs
* We develop the data structure and services needed as a **Serverless Back-End** fully optimized and made to fit the final data required by the app/web-app or website.
* We don't build unnecesary payloads or overengineered and monolithic Back-End structures.
