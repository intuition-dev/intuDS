#1. make example like docuSar in pug folder
( for http://staticgen.com )

1.a may need to fix json -i in mbCLI  htts://jsonfeed.org/version/1

0.a there is few 'checkbox' nav. examples here
 eg http://getpapercss.com/docs/components/navbar
0.b touch up 'css' SRC here, the example needs to be nicer checkbox nav
 notice new way of fonts to be AMP
 and clean html and sass
 (came from http://mincss.com )

pug example should be teachable to 'dummies' 
include landing page, blog and doc|api

instead of front matter markdown we use yaml ?

so just an example
